# Andres KÃµljalg portfolio project

As a creative, it felt weird to me to showcase my creative works using a website builder template that a lot of other people also use. It just felt like I needed my creativity to extend to the way I showcase it as well. As I dived into UX design and prototyping, I didn't know how tough this journey was going to be.

Iâ€™m not a developer, but I've learned a lot during this project. This is my first deeper dive into coding with an actual outcomeâ€”a journey that began **4 years ago** with simple experiments in **Adobe XD**, eventually evolving into a more refined vision in **Figma**. This project has seen **three pivots**, and now, this is the **final version**.

Originally, it was called **akporf-v2-valge**, and it all started when I asked [**@freduard**](https://github.com/freduard), a friendâ€™s brother, to help me bring my idea to life. This was **his first major project**, and we both learned a lot throughout the process. The initial development began with **PHP**, and for a while, it was all about trying to make something that felt right for meâ€”a creative space to showcase my work.

### The long pause ðŸ•’
This project was never deployed. The PHP setup made it difficult to use services like **Vercel**, and as I explored other technologies, the project started gathering dust in my **GitHub repository**. Since **May 2022**, it sat there, unfinished, waiting for the right time to come back to life.

### Picking It Up Again in 2024
A lot has changed since those early days. In **November 2024**, I decided to pick it up again, this time determined to make it work in a modern, more flexible environment. This meant:

- **Migrating to Vercel**: I needed a solution that could easily deploy my project, and Vercel offered the perfect platform for it. However, this also meant I had to make the PHP backend compatible, which was a challenge in itself.

- **Adding a CMS**: One big upgrade was integrating **Contentful** as a headless CMS. This change allowed me to manage my projects dynamicallyâ€”making it easy to add, edit, or remove content without ever touching the code again.

- **Making it dynamic**: Instead of hardcoded project entries, I made everything dynamic by connecting it to **Contentful**. Now, the website fetches content directly from the CMS, ensuring that itâ€™s always up-to-date without any manual updates.

### Whatâ€™s inside?
This portfolio features **Photography**, **Design**, **Other Projects**, and a **Journal** section. Projects are dynamically fetched from **Contentful** using its **Content Delivery API** and are displayed beautifully. The **Journal** section is used as an output to showcase moments of my daily life.

This project is very much a personal explorationâ€”bringing together everything Iâ€™ve learned and everything I wanted my portfolio to be. From **responsive design** to **content optimization**, each piece is carefully crafted to represent my work and my journey.

Shoutout to [**@freduard**](https://github.com/freduard) for helping me kickstart this journey. Thank you for taking a look at my portfolio, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I did creating it!
