                <p class="mb-4">I've spent most of the past 5 years of my life behind the lens, shooting people, action sports and cars
                    I launched my own skateboarding magazine with my photos, articles, color managing and design,
                    which is the only one in the Baltics. On the personal level, I am all about smiles.</p> 
                <p class="mb-4">
                    On my free time you can find me behind a steering wheel of old-school cars,
                    on a skateboard or behind the lens. Im also really passionate about music. For me, a day doesn't go
                    by without digging through the deepest part of the internet for some "hidden" gems. If you skate, 
                    have a cool car or spin records, we definetly have something to talk about!
